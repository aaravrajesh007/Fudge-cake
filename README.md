A very chocolatey, moist Chocolate Fudge Cake that is similar to chocolate mud cake, but not as dense. Made with both melted chocolate and cocoa, AND topped with chocolate ganache, this one is sure to satisfying your chocolate cravings!

Super easy to make, very forgiving, no stand mixer or beater. Just one bowl and a wooden spoon!
